# Conclusion

In our project of analysis suicide rates, we explored hierarchical relationships in the dataset, time series trends and correlations across demographic factors, with a focus on the year 2021. The trends exploration underscored age-related vulnerabilities, with younger groups like 15-24 and 25-44 have more rapid increasing suicide rate compared to middle-aged and older groups. We superisingly find that American Indian and Alaska Native individuals, especially males aged 25-44, consistently exhibited the highest suicide rates, followed by White males across older age groups. Females generally had lower rates, except for specific subpopulations like American Indian and Alaska Native women aged 25-44.  Despite these insights, the study faced limitations. The most essential one is that we only use the data from 2021 for analysis, which contained significant missing values, such as those for Native Hawaiian females, potentially skewing the findings. By focusing on a single year, we could not explore temporal trends or assess whether the observed patterns are consistent over time. Future directions should include a longitudinal analysis to assess trends and correlations over time, improving completeness and robustness. Moreover, the hierarchical and overlapping nature of the dataset posed challenges, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to handle such complexities effectively. From this project, we gain the critical ability of managing complex hierarchical datasets, dealing with overlapping classifications, and using effective visualization tools to clarify relationships within the data. Moreover, we gained experience in balancing simplicity and depth in data representation, handling missing values thoughtfully, and conduct analyses to address specific questions while maintaining a broader perspective.
