# Introduction

In this project, we aim to explore the death rates for suicide in the United States, segmented by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. Suicide, defined as the act of intentionally causing oneâ€™s own death, is a significant public health issue with profound personal and societal consequences. According to the CDC website, suicide is a leading cause of death, affecting individuals across all age groups and demographics. It has a far-reaching impact on both the individuals directly involved and on their families, communities, and society at large. Importantly, certain groups experience higher suicide rates than others, which underscores the importance of understanding these patterns to develop targeted interventions. Through this project, we hope to explore the patterns in suicide rates across different demographic groups and over time, which may support the creation of tailored prevention strategies. Specifically, we will investigate how suicide rates differ by gender, examining whether males or females are more vulnerable within specific contexts. We will also explore racial and ethnic disparities, identifying whether certain groups face unique risks. Additionally, we will analyze how suicide trends have evolved between 1999 and 2020, asking whether these patterns have changed over time for different demographic groups.
