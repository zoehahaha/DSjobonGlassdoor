    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we aim to explore the death rates for suicide in the United States, segmented by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. Suicide, defined as the act of intentionally causing one’s own death, is a significant public health issue with profound personal and societal consequences. According to the CDC website, suicide is a leading cause of death, affecting individuals across all age groups and demographics. It has a far-reaching impact on both the individuals directly involved and on their families, communities, and society at large. Importantly, certain groups experience higher suicide rates than others, which underscores the importance of understanding these patterns to develop targeted interventions. Through this project, we hope to explore the patterns in suicide rates across different demographic groups and over time, which may support the creation of tailored prevention strategies. Specifically, we will investigate how suicide rates differ by gender, examining whether males or females are more vulnerable within specific contexts. We will also explore racial and ethnic disparities, identifying whether certain groups face unique risks. Additionally, we will analyze how suicide trends have evolved between 1999 and 2020, asking whether these patterns have changed over time for different demographic groups.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nIn this project, we will use the “Death Rates for Suicide” dataset from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The dataset is published by the National Center for Health Statistics and is updated annually. It is provided as a CSV file containing 21 columns and 3,786 rows. However, there are some challenges with the dataset. Likely due to privacy concerns, the dataset does not explicitly explain how the data was collected, and there is a lack of transparency regarding the calculation process for the estimates. Additionally, the dataset requires careful preprocessing for analysis, as there are hierarchical relationships between levels in some columns. For example, in the “Subgroup” column, levels such as “Female: 25-34 years” are subgroup of “Female,” depending on their corresponding “Group” column level (“Sex and age group” intersects with “Sex”). This hierarchical structure necessitates detailed hard works on preprocessing. For importing the dataset, we will store it in a GitHub repository to ensure centralized and version-controlled access. Using the raw file link from GitHub, we will import the data directly into RStudio using the read.csv() function for analysis. Here is the link to our dataset’s website: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/DQS-Death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-Hispanic-o/p7se-k3ix/about_data",

We can see that there are 3 columns are all NAs towards the whoe dataset: “SUBTOPIC_ID”, “SUBTOPIC” and “FLAG”. One possible explanation is that this dataset doesn’t have any subtopic. For columns of “STANDARD_ERROR”, “ESTIMATE_UCI”, “ESTIMATE_LCI” and “ESTIMATE”, they have 182 missing values respectively. Judging by the name of columns, it’s easy to see their correlation so they have the same counts in missing values. Notice that, “ESTIMATE” column represents the number of death per 100,000 resident population, which is the most important information in this dataset. Thus, we need dig deep in this variable.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_counts &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(GROUP, TIME_PERIOD) %&gt;%\n  summarise(missing_count = sum(is.na(ESTIMATE)), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Create a heatmap\nggplot(missing_counts, aes(x = GROUP, y = TIME_PERIOD, fill = missing_count)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"red\", na.value = \"grey80\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values in 'ESTIMATE' by Group and Time Period\",\n       x = \"Group\",\n       y = \"Time Period\",\n       fill = \"Missing Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap reveals the distribution of missing values in the “ESTIMATE” column, across various Group categories and Time Periods. The blank spaces in the heatmap represent combinations of “GROUP” and “TIME_PERIOD” where no data exists in the dataset. This means that for certain subgroups during specific time periods, no rows are present in the data.\nFor the majority of groups, such as Age group, Sex, and simpler combinations like Sex and race, the data appears consistently available from 2000 to 2015. This is reflected in the lighter blue areas of the heatmap, signifying minimal missing values in these categories. These groups represent higher levels of aggregation, where data collection and reporting are typically more consistent and reliable.\nHowever, a significant increase in missing values is observed for the year 2020 across several categories, particularly for complex subgroups such as Sex, race, and Hispanic origin, and age group. These are represented by darker shades of red or entirely blank areas in the heatmap, highlighting substantial gaps in the data. This trend suggests potential challenges in data collection or reporting for detailed subgroup intersections during this time period, which may have been influenced by disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In Hispanic communities, strong familial and community support, often referred to as familismo, plays a protective role, providing emotional and social safety nets that may reduce the risk of suicide. Religious beliefs, particularly within Catholicism, often discourage suicide, adding another layer of protection. However, cultural stigma around mental health often prevents open discussion and limits access to mental health resources, which can both suppress suicide risk and lead to underreporting.\nEconomic challenges also contribute to these differences. Many Hispanic individuals face lower income levels, unstable employment, and limited access to healthcare, which can exacerbate mental health issues while also restricting their documentation and treatment. For Hispanic immigrants, acculturation stress, discrimination, and immigration-related fears add further mental health burdens. Among Hispanic youth, acculturation gaps between parents and children can lead to family conflict, which has been linked to higher suicide risk, particularly among second-generation youth.\nThe term Hispanic encompasses diverse populations, and suicide risk factors vary among subgroups. For instance, Puerto Ricans have been reported to experience higher suicide rates, particularly among youth, due to economic and social challenges. Conversely, Cuban Americans often display lower rates, possibly due to stronger economic stability and established community networks. Mexican Americans, the largest Hispanic group in the U.S., are heavily studied, with risk factors often tied to immigration and acculturation dynamics.\nIn summary, the lower suicide rates in Hispanic populations reflect protective cultural factors such as strong familial bonds and religious beliefs. However, socioeconomic challenges, acculturation stress, and limited access to mental health resources pose significant risks, particularly for certain subgroups and second-generation immigrants. Addressing these disparities requires culturally sensitive interventions, expanded mental health resources, and programs that strengthen family and community cohesion.",
