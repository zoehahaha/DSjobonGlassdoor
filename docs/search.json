    "title": "Explanatory Analysis on Suicide Death Rate",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we aim to explore the death rates for suicide in the United States, segmented by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. Suicide, defined as the act of intentionally causing one’s own death, is a significant public health issue with profound personal and societal consequences. According to the CDC website, suicide is a leading cause of death, affecting individuals across all age groups and demographics. It has a far-reaching impact on both the individuals directly involved and on their families, communities, and society at large. Importantly, certain groups experience higher suicide rates than others, which underscores the importance of understanding these patterns to develop targeted interventions. Through this project, we hope to explore the patterns in suicide rates across different demographic groups and over time, which may support the creation of tailored prevention strategies. Specifically, we will investigate how suicide rates differ by gender, examining whether males or females are more vulnerable within specific contexts. We will also explore racial and ethnic disparities, identifying whether certain groups face unique risks. Additionally, we will analyze how suicide trends have evolved between 1999 and 2020, asking whether these patterns have changed over time for different demographic groups.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nIn this project, we will use the “Death Rates for Suicide” dataset from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The dataset is published by the National Center for Health Statistics and is updated annually. How data is colleted is not explicitly mentioned. It is provided as a CSV file containing 21 columns and 3,786 rows. However, there are some challenges with the dataset. Likely due to privacy concerns, the dataset does not explicitly explain how the data was collected, and there is a lack of transparency regarding the calculation process for the estimates. Additionally, the dataset requires careful preprocessing for analysis, as there are hierarchical relationships between levels in some columns. For example, in the “Subgroup” column, levels such as “Female: 25-34 years” are subgroup of “Female,” depending on their corresponding “Group” column level (“Sex and age group” intersects with “Sex”). This hierarchical structure necessitates detailed hard works on preprocessing. For importing the dataset, we will store it in a GitHub repository to ensure centralized and version-controlled access. Using the raw file link from GitHub, we will import the data directly into RStudio using the read.csv() function for analysis.

We can see that there are 3 columns are all NAs towards the whoe dataset: “SUBTOPIC_ID”, “SUBTOPIC” and “FLAG”. One possible explanation is that this dataset doesn’t have any subtopic. For columns of “STANDARD_ERROR”, “ESTIMATE_UCI”, “ESTIMATE_LCI” and “ESTIMATE”, they have 182 missing values respectively. Judging by the name of columns, it’s easy to see their correlation so they have the same counts in missing values. Notice that, “ESTIMATE” column represents the number of death per 100,000 resident population, which is the most important information in this dataset. Thus, we need dig deep in this variable.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_counts &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(GROUP, TIME_PERIOD) %&gt;%\n  summarise(missing_count = sum(is.na(ESTIMATE)), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Create a heatmap\nggplot(missing_counts, aes(x = GROUP, y = TIME_PERIOD, fill = missing_count)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"red\", na.value = \"grey80\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values in 'ESTIMATE' by Group and Time Period\",\n       x = \"Group\",\n       y = \"Time Period\",\n       fill = \"Missing Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap reveals the distribution of missing values in the “ESTIMATE” column, across various Group categories and Time Periods. The blank spaces in the heatmap represent combinations of “GROUP” and “TIME_PERIOD” where no data exists in the dataset. This means that for certain subgroups during specific time periods, no rows are present in the data.\nFor the majority of groups, such as Age group, Sex, and simpler combinations like Sex and race, the data appears consistently available from 2000 to 2015. This is reflected in the lighter blue areas of the heatmap, signifying minimal missing values in these categories. These groups represent higher levels of aggregation, where data collection and reporting are typically more consistent and reliable.\nHowever, a significant increase in missing values is observed for the year 2020 across several categories, particularly for complex subgroups such as Sex, race, and Hispanic origin, and age group. These are represented by darker shades of red or entirely blank areas in the heatmap, highlighting substantial gaps in the data. This trend suggests potential challenges in data collection or reporting for detailed subgroup intersections during this time period, which may have been influenced by disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For the completely blank columns, namely ‘SUBTOPIC’, ‘SUBTOPIC_ID’, and ‘FLAG’, we will remove them entirely as they do not provide any useful information. Also for the Column ‘TOPIC’, values for each row are same (value = “Death rates for suicide”) which is not useful. Therefore we will remove ‘TOPIC’ column as well.\nFor rows with missing values in the ‘ESTIMATE’ column, we will replace the missing values with -1 instead of removing the rows. This approach is taken because each row in our dataset contains unique and critical information about a specific subgroup in a given year. Removing such rows could result in the complete loss of information for certain subgroups. Since ‘ESTIMATE’ values must be greater than zero, using -1 will clearly indicate missing data without overlapping with valid entries. We will apply the same method to handle missing values in the ‘STANDARD_ERROR’, ‘ESTIMATE_UCI’, and ‘ESTIMATE_LCI’ columns.\nAfter checking, there are no missing value in the dataset now."

Among these 17 columns, 5 are categorical variables, and 12 are numerical variables. Within the numerical columns, 6 serve as corresponding series numbers linked to specific categorical columns, essentially acting as identifiers or keys. Therefore, the columns we focus on, which provide the most valuable insights, include the categorical variables: ESTIMATE_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, GROUP, SUBGROUP, and TIME_PERIOD, as well as the key numerical variable ESTIMATE.\nThe table above illustrates the levels within the categorical variables, highlighting their variety and structure. Upon closer examination, we observed a hierarchical relationship among some columns. Specifically, the GROUP column serves as a subdivision of CLASSIFICATION, while SUBGROUP represents a further division of GROUP. This hierarchy reflects the nested nature of these variables and provides a structured way to organize and interpret the data. For example, a single CLASSIFICATION may encompass multiple GROUPS, and each GROUP can be broken down into several SUBGROUPS.\nIn addition to the hierarchical relationships, there are also overlaps, inclusions, and disjoint relationships within certain columns, particularly in the GROUP and SUBGROUP variables. These relationships make the dataset more complex, as some groups or subgroups may belong to multiple categories, while others are entirely distinct. The overlapping for SUBGROUP column is introduced by the GROUP columns due the horizontally hierarchy, so we can use GROUP column as key when we want to choose any specific SUBGROUP for analysis. In general, overlapping and inclusion can introduce ambiguity if not carefully understood and managed.\nUnderstanding the hierarchy and relationships within the dataset is crucial for extracting the most relevant and accurate information. It helps maintains clarity on how CLASSIFICATION, GROUP, and SUBGROUP interact allows us to accurately group and segment the data to explore different questions, identify trends, and derive insights. This structured approach to understanding the dataset lays a strong foundation for conducting reliable analysis and presenting clear, effective visualizations.\n\n\n3.2.2 Static Hierarchy Visualization (Tree Diagram)\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare the data for hierarchy\nhierarchy_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(CLASSIFICATION, GROUP, SUBGROUP) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n# Calculate counts for subgroups under each group\ngroup_subgroup_counts &lt;- hierarchy_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLASSIFICATION, GROUP) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Number_of_Subgroups = n_distinct(SUBGROUP), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Build hierarchical edges\nedges &lt;- group_subgroup_counts %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    from_root = \"Data\",\n    from_class = CLASSIFICATION,\n    from_group = paste0(GROUP,\".\"), \n    to_group = paste0(\"# of Subgroups: \", Number_of_Subgroups)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(\n    from = from_root, to = from_class\n  ) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows(\n    group_subgroup_counts %&gt;%\n      mutate(from = CLASSIFICATION, to = paste0(GROUP,\".\")) %&gt;%  # Only keep GROUP name\n      select(from, to)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  bind_rows(\n    group_subgroup_counts %&gt;%\n      mutate(from = paste0(GROUP,\".\"), \n             to = paste0(\"# of Subgroups: \", Number_of_Subgroups)) %&gt;%\n      select(from, to)\n  )\n\n# Create igraph object\ngraph &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE)\n\n# Set plot size\noptions(repr.plot.width = 14, repr.plot.height = 10)  # Adjust figure dimensions\n\n# Improved Visualization\nggraph(graph, layout = \"tree\") +  # Use tree layout\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point(size = 3, color = \"skyblue\") +  # Add nodes\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 0.4, vjust = -1.2, angle = 35, size = 4.5) +  # Add labels\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20),  \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Hierarchy Visualization of Dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"Dataset → Classifications → Groups → Number of Subgroups\",\n    x = NULL, y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Figure 1: The hierarchy from the dataset classifications to groups and their corresponding number of subgroups.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use tree diagram to effectively visualizes the hierarchical structure between columns of the dataset, illustrating the relationships between different levels: from the dataset as a whole to classifications, groups, and subgroups. By breaking down the dataset into its hierarchical components, the diagram provides clarity on how data is organized and structured, highlighting the nested relationships between categories. One notable adjustment in the visualization is the representation of the GROUP to SUBGROUP layer. Instead of listing all 201 branches from the group layer to the subgroup layer—which would overwhelm the visualization—we aggregate this complexity by summarizing the number of subgroups for each group. This approach enhances readability and ensures that the graph remains clean and interpretable. In the figure 1 in the Interactive graph part, there is a more detailed and comprehensive tree diagram. Due to the benefits animation, the branch is more readable."

    "text": "3.3 Trends Over Time\nIn this section, we will analyze the trends in suicide rates over time under various divisions (total, age groups, genders, racial categories). This approach will help us identify temporal patterns and any significant disparities or shifts within these divisions, offering insights into how suicide rates have evolved and how they differ across subpopulations. By leveraging both crude and age-adjusted rates appropriately, we aim to present a comprehensive and balanced view of these trends.\nCrude suicide rate refers to the total number of suicides per 100,000 individuals in a population without accounting for differences in age distribution. It provides a direct measure of the overall suicide rate within a population. On the other hand, the age-adjusted suicide rate adjusts for variations in the age structure of different populations, allowing for fairer comparisons across populations with different age distributions or over time as a population’s age composition changes. For this analysis, we will use the crude suicide rate when visualizing suicide rates across specific age ranges, as it directly reflects the raw rates within those categories. However, for broader comparisons and understanding trends over time across different groups or divisions, the age-adjusted rate is more appropriate as it minimizes the confounding effect of age structure, providing a clearer picture of trends unaffected by demographic differences.\n\n\nCode\n# Define a function to plot suicide rates by subgroup without faceting\nplot_suicide_rates_combined &lt;- function(data, group_id, type_id) {\n  # Filter for only one method of ESTIMATE calculation\n  filtered_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n    filter(ESTIMATE_TYPE_ID == type_id)\n  \n  # Filter data based on the input group_id\n  filtered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n    filter(GROUP_ID == group_id)\n  \n  # Extract the group name for the given group_id\n  group_name &lt;- unique(filtered_data$GROUP)\n  \n  # Convert TIME_PERIOD to factor to display all years on the x-axis\n  filtered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(TIME_PERIOD = factor(TIME_PERIOD, levels = sort(unique(TIME_PERIOD))))\n  \n  # Create the combined plot\n  ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = ESTIMATE, color = SUBGROUP, group = SUBGROUP)) +\n    geom_line(size = 1) +\n    geom_point(size = 1) +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Suicide Rates by\", group_name, \"Over Time\"),\n      x = \"Year\",\n      y = \"Suicide Rate (per 100,000)\",\n      color = \"Subgroup\"\n    ) +\n    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) + # Ensure no levels are dropped\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      legend.position = \"bottom\",\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), # Rotate labels for better readability\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15)\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Trend for Suicide Rate by Total population\n\n\nCode\nplot_suicide_rates_combined(data, group_id = 1,1)+\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 2: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2021 by all age\")+\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above displays the suicide rate (per 100,000 individuals) on the y-axis over time, with the x-axis representing the years from 1999 to 2021. The trend shows a general increase in suicide rates over this period, starting at around 10.5 per 100,000 in 1999 and peaking at around 14.2 per 100,000 at 2018, followed by minor fluctuations.

The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis shows the suicide rates.\n15-24 years: The suicide rate for this group starts relatively low in 1999 but exhibits a sharp and consistent increase, especially after 2010. This group experiences the one of the most rapid rate of growth among all age ranges. The steep rise in recent years highlights an urgent need for intervention focused on younger populations.\n25-34 years: The suicide rates are in general higher than 15-24 in each year but shows similar trends as 15-24 years, with rapid increase recent years. Reflecting stable yet consistent growth in suicide rates. This trend highlights a sustained issue for this age group, requiring ongoing attention.\n35-44 years: This group exhibits a more gradual increase over time. While the trend is upward, it shows less dramatic changes compared to younger age groups. The growth rate for this group appears stable with minor fluctuations, indicating less volatility over the years.\n45-54 years: The trend for this age group shows a stable upward movement with moderate fluctuations. Suicide rates increase gradually over time, but the growth is not as severe as in younger groups. It reach the peak around 2012, followed by a relatively steady phase and slight decrease recent years.\n55-64 years: The 55-64 years group displays a moderate upward trend similar to the 45-54 age range. Rates rise steadily over the years but without dramatic spikes. This consistent growth suggests that mid-to-late adulthood is also a critical period for preventive measures.\n65-74 years and 75-84 years: These older age groups show relatively stable trends with a moderate increase over the years. Both groups display minor fluctuations but no significant spikes. While the overall rates remain high compared to younger groups, the trends are less alarming in terms of growth rate.\n85 years and older: The oldest age group consistently has the highest overall suicide rates. Although the trend is relatively stable until 2015, there is a sharp increase in recent years, peaking significantly by 2021. This pattern suggests that late-life stressors or challenges may have intensified in recent years.\nKey Concerns: The suicide rate among younger age groups has risen dramatically, warranting heightened attention and concern.\n\n\nCode\ndata_temp &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(SUBGROUP %in% c(\n    \"10-14 years\", \"15-19 years\", \"20-24 years\"\n  ))\n\n# Plot the filtered data\nplot_suicide_rates_combined(data_temp, group_id = 2, 2) +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 4.1: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2021 by young age groups 10-24, 4 years range\") +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter the data for the specific conditions\ndata_fig4 &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    ESTIMATE_TYPE_ID == 2,\n    GROUP_ID == 2,\n    SUBGROUP %in% c(\"10-14 years\", \"15-19 years\", \"20-24 years\")\n  )\n\n# Extract the group name for the given GROUP_ID\ngroup_name &lt;- unique(data_fig4$GROUP)\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart\nggplot(data_fig4, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = ESTIMATE, fill = SUBGROUP)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Suicide Rates by\", group_name, \"Over Time\"),\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Suicide Rate (per 100,000)\",\n    fill = \"Subgroup\",\n    caption = \"Figure 4.2: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2021 by young age groups 10-24, 4 years range\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suicide rates across young age groups (10-24 years) highlights a troubling pattern: older subgroups consistently experience a higher rates, reflecting significant vulnerabilities during early adulthood. The age group 15-19 take has a overall higher suicide rate than 10-14 years old in all years from 1999 to 2021, and 20-24 has a overal higher suicide rate than 15-19. At the same time, younger groups, like 10-14 years and 15-19 years, show gradual yet steady increases, signaling growing mental health challenges even at an early age.\n\n\n3.3.3 Trend for Suicide Rates by Sex Over Time\n\n\nCode\nplot_suicide_rates_combined(data, group_id = 3,1)+\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 5: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2021 by young age groups 10-24, 4 years range\") +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis updated graph provides a clearer view of the trends in suicide rates by sex from 1999 to 2021. The suicide rate for males consistently remains significantly higher than for females throughout the entire period. Male rates start at approximately 18 per 100,000 in 1999 and gradually rise, peaking around 2017-2018, before showing a slight decline and leveling off towards 2021. For females, the suicide rate starts at around 3 per 100,000 and shows a slow and steady upward trend, with minimal fluctuations. The stark disparity between male and female suicide rates highlights a persistent and significant issue, with males being at substantially higher risk.\n\n\n3.3.4 Trend for Suicide Rates by Race Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# Create a dataset with combined race groups by averaging male and female estimates\ncombine_race_data &lt;- function(data) {\n  # Filter for \"sex and race\" group\n  data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n    filter(ESTIMATE_TYPE_ID == 1)\n  \n  race_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n    filter(GROUP == \"Sex and race\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(Race = case_when(\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(46, 50) ~ \"American Indian and Alaska Native\",\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(47, 51) ~ \"Asian or Pacific Islander\",\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(48, 52) ~ \"Black\",\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(49, 53) ~ \"White\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Exclude other categories\n    )) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(Race))  # Remove rows that are not part of the selected races\n  \n  # Group by Time Period and Race, then calculate the average estimate\n  combined_race_data &lt;- race_data %&gt;%\n    group_by(TIME_PERIOD, Race) %&gt;%\n    summarize(Avg_Estimate = mean(ESTIMATE, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n  \n  return(combined_race_data)\n}\n\n# Apply the function to dataset\nrace_trend_data &lt;- combine_race_data(data)\nrace_trend_data  &lt;- race_trend_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(TIME_PERIOD = factor(TIME_PERIOD, levels = sort(unique(TIME_PERIOD))))\n\n# Plot the trend over time by race\nggplot(race_trend_data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = Avg_Estimate, color = Race, group = Race)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Suicide Rates by Race Over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Suicide Rate (per 100,000)\",\n    color = \"Race\",\n    caption = \"Figure 6: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2019 by race\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph displays the trends in suicide rates across four racial groups from 1999 to 2019.\nWhite:\nThe White racial group consistently exhibits the highest suicide rates over the entire period. Starting at around 12 per 100,000 in 1999, the rate gradually increases over time, peaking at over 16 per 100,000 around 2017-2018 before showing a slight decline. This steady upward trend highlights significant mental health challenges within this group.\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native:\nThis group shows the second-highest suicide rates, starting at approximately 10 per 100,000 in 1999. While the trend remains relatively stable for much of the timeline, there is a notable spike around 2004, followed by some fluctuation and a gradual rise after 2015. The persistent high rates in this group emphasize the need for targeted mental health interventions addressing probably specific cultural and systemic challenges.\nAsian or Pacific Islander:\nThe Asian or Pacific Islander group has one of the lowest suicide rates, with values starting near 6 per 100,000 in 1999. The trend remains largely stable over the years, with only slight increases after 2014.\nBlack:\nThe Black group also has lower suicide rates, similar to the Asian or Pacific Islander group, starting at approximately 6 per 100,000 in 1999. However, unlike the Asian group, this group maintains a lower suicide steadily rate over time until 2015. Then start increasing reaching nearly 7 per 100,000 by 2019. The steady rise indicates growing mental health challenges that require focused attention.\n\n\n3.3.5 Trend for Suicide Rates by whether-hispanic Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# Combine Hispanic and Non-Hispanic groups by averaging their respective SUBGROUP_IDs\nhispanic_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(ESTIMATE_TYPE_ID == 1)\n\nhispanic_data &lt;- hispanic_data %&gt;%\n  filter(SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Hispanic_Group = case_when(\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(54, 59) ~ \"Hispanic\",\n      SUBGROUP_ORDER %in% c(55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63) ~ \"Non-Hispanic\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Hispanic_Group, TIME_PERIOD) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    ESTIMATE = mean(ESTIMATE, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nhispanic_data  &lt;- hispanic_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(TIME_PERIOD = factor(TIME_PERIOD, levels = sort(unique(TIME_PERIOD))))\n\n\n# Plot Hispanic vs Non-Hispanic trends over time\nggplot(hispanic_data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = ESTIMATE, color = Hispanic_Group, group = Hispanic_Group)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Trends in Suicide Rates: Hispanic vs Non-Hispanic Groups\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Suicide Rate (per 100,000)\",\n    color = \"Group\",\n    caption = \"Figure 7: Suicide Rates From 1999 to 2019 by whether hispanic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph compares suicide rates between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic groups from 1999 to 2019. The Non-Hispanic group consistently exhibits higher suicide rates throughout the period, starting at approximately 9 per 100,000 in 1999 and gradually increasing to over 12.5 per 100,000 by 2019. In contrast, the Hispanic group (red line) maintains significantly lower suicide rates, starting at around 6 per 100,000 in 1999 and experiencing a slight but steady increase over the years, peaking at just above 7 per 100,000 by 2019. The widening gap between the two groups highlights a persistent disparity, with Non-Hispanic individuals facing significantly higher suicide risks. This trend underscores the importance of exploring cultural, social, and systemic factors that may contribute to these differences. We do some exploration in Hispanic population below.\nThe disparity in suicide rates between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations is influenced by a combination of cultural, social, economic, and systemic factors. In Hispanic communities, strong familial and community support, often referred to as familismo, plays a protective role, providing emotional and social safety nets that may reduce the risk of suicide. Religious beliefs, particularly within Catholicism, often discourage suicide, adding another layer of protection. However, cultural stigma around mental health often prevents open discussion and limits access to mental health resources, which can both suppress suicide risk and lead to underreporting.\nEconomic challenges also contribute to these differences. Many Hispanic individuals face lower income levels, unstable employment, and limited access to healthcare, which can exacerbate mental health issues while also restricting their documentation and treatment. For Hispanic immigrants, acculturation stress, discrimination, and immigration-related fears add further mental health burdens. Among Hispanic youth, acculturation gaps between parents and children can lead to family conflict, which has been linked to higher suicide risk, particularly among second-generation youth.\nThe term Hispanic encompasses diverse populations, and suicide risk factors vary among subgroups. For instance, Puerto Ricans have been reported to experience higher suicide rates, particularly among youth, due to economic and social challenges. Conversely, Cuban Americans often display lower rates, possibly due to stronger economic stability and established community networks. Mexican Americans, the largest Hispanic group in the U.S., are heavily studied, with risk factors often tied to immigration and acculturation dynamics.\nIn summary, the lower suicide rates in Hispanic populations reflect protective cultural factors such as strong familial bonds and religious beliefs. However, socioeconomic challenges, acculturation stress, and limited access to mental health resources pose significant risks, particularly for certain subgroups and second-generation immigrants. Addressing these disparities requires culturally sensitive interventions, expanded mental health resources, and programs that strengthen family and community cohesion."

This subset, data_2021, was then further refined to include only the data corresponding to a specific GROUP_ID (Eliminate overlapping relation inside the column by selecting a specific group) and underwent several transformations to enhance its usability and analytical clarity. Specifically, new columns were added to encode key demographic attributes:\n\nA sex column was created to classify subgroups as “Male” or “Female” based on the SUBGROUP text.\nA race column was added to categorize individuals into racial groups and origin (e.g., Asian, Black, White, Hispanic) or mark them as “Other” when no clear racial identifier was present based on the SUBGROUP text. (Given the selected GROUP_ID, the subgroups available include information on sex, race and Hispanic origin (single race), and age group. In the data, individuals identified as non-Hispanic belong to specific racial groups, while those identified as Hispanic represent a general category encompassing all races. Due to this structure, we treat “Hispanic” as an independent category, separate from the specific race groups within the non-Hispanic classification, to account for the unique nature of this division.)\nAn age_range column was introduced to group individuals into predefined age ranges (e.g., 15-24, 25-44, etc.) using pattern matching on SUBGROUP text.(age range suggest that this estimate type for estimate will be crude)\n\nFinally, unnecessary columns were removed to streamline the dataset, leaving only the essential fields: SUBGROUP, SUBGROUP_ID, SUBGROUP_ORDER, ESTIMATE, sex, age_range, and race. The resulting dataset, data_2021_10, is more concise and organized, facilitating deeper analysis of demographic patterns within a targeted subgroup for the year 2021.\n\n\nCode\nhead(data_2021_10)\n\n\n                                                                   SUBGROUP\n1                                  Female: All races, Hispanic: 15-24 years\n2                                  Female: All races, Hispanic: 25-44 years\n3                                  Female: All races, Hispanic: 45-64 years\n4                           Female: All races, Hispanic: 65 years and older\n5 Female: American Indian and Alaska Native only, non-Hispanic: 15-24 years\n6 Female: American Indian and Alaska Native only, non-Hispanic: 25-44 years\n  SUBGROUP_ID SUBGROUP_ORDER ESTIMATE    sex    age_range\n1       10.27            116      4.7 Female        15-24\n2       10.28            117      4.6 Female        25-44\n3       10.29            118      2.9 Female        45-64\n4       10.31            119      1.7 Female 65 and older\n5       10.32            120     23.0 Female        15-24\n6       10.33            121     25.3 Female        25-44\n                               race\n1                          Hispanic\n2                          Hispanic\n3                          Hispanic\n4                          Hispanic\n5 American Indian and Alaska Native\n6 American Indian and Alaska Native\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Suicide Rate vs Sex, 2021\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data_2021_10, aes(x = as.factor(sex), y = ESTIMATE, fill = as.factor(sex))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot of Suicide Rates by Sex in 2021\",\n    x = \"Sex (0 = Male, 1 = Female)\",\n    y = \"Suicide Rate (per 100,000)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\",\n    caption = \"Figure 8: Boxplots for Suicide Rates by sex in 2021\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme( legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot shows that median suicide rate is significantly higher for males, as depicted by the central line within the male boxplot, which lies far above the female median.

Finally, the 65 and older group moderately falls into the “low than average” category, showing a moderate negative correlation between being in this age group and elevated suicide rates.\nThese findings reveal that younger age groups (15-24 and 25-44) are more prone to higher-than-average suicide rates, whereas middle-aged and older individuals (45-64 and 65+) are less likely to exceed the average suicide rate, highlighting distinct age-related risk patterns.\n\n\n3.4.5 Suicide Rate vs Sex + Age + Race\n\n\nCode\n# Replace -1 with NA\ndata_2021_10 &lt;- data_2021_10 %&gt;%\n  mutate(ESTIMATE = ifelse(ESTIMATE == -1, NA, ESTIMATE))\n\ncreate_heatmap_by_sex &lt;- function(data, sex_filter) {\n  ggplot(data %&gt;% filter(sex == sex_filter), aes(x = race, y = age_range, fill = ESTIMATE)) +\n    geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"yellow\", high = \"darkred\", na.value = \"white\", name = \"Suicide Rate\") +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Heatmap of Suicide Rates by Age Range and Race (Sex:\", ifelse(sex_filter == 0, \"Male\", \"Female\"), \")\"),\n      x = \"Race\",\n      y = \"Age Range\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12), # Reduce title size\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), # Smaller x-axis labels\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8), # Smaller y-axis labels\n      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10), # Smaller x-axis title\n      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10), # Smaller y-axis title\n      plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5), # Smaller caption\n      plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5) # Reduce margins\n    )\n}\n\n# Generate heatmaps for male and female\nheatmap_male &lt;- create_heatmap_by_sex(data_2021_10, sex_filter = \"Male\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Figure 14: Proportion of suicide rates across age and racial groups for males and females in 2021.

For females, the highest suicide rates are observed among American Indian and Alaska Native women in the 25-44 age range, and the second highest is the women in 15-24 in that race. Women in white with 45-64 and 25-44 also have a relatively high suicide rate. For males, the highest suicide rates are likely among American Indian and Alaska Native men in the 25-44 age range and 15-24 age, with White men also exhibiting relatively high rates in all age range, especially for the 45-64 and 65 and older categories. Native Hawaiian from 25 to 44 also shows a relatively high rate.\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare data for the alluvial diagram\nalluvial_data &lt;- data_2021_10 %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate_level = ifelse(ESTIMATE &gt; median(ESTIMATE, na.rm = TRUE), \"Higher than average\", \"Lower than average\")) %&gt;%\n  select(rate_level, sex, age_range, race) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(rate_level), !is.na(sex), !is.na(age_range), !is.na(race))\n\n# Wrap long text in the race column\nalluvial_data &lt;- alluvial_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(race = gsub(\" and \", \"\\n\", race))\n\n# Create the alluvial diagram\nggplot(alluvial_data, aes(axis1 = sex, axis2 = age_range, axis3 = race, y = 1, fill = rate_level)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = rate_level)) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/2, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 3) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Sex\", \"Age Range\", \"Race\"), expand = c(0.1, 0.1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Higher than average\" = \"orange\", \"Lower than average\" = \"green\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Alluvial Diagram of Suicide Rates by Sex, Age, and Race\",\n    caption = \"Figure 16: the flow of suicide rates categorized as high or low across sex, age range, and race\",\n    x = \"Demographic Factors\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Rate Level\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the alluvial diagram, we can see that females are predominantly associated with lower suicide rates across all age ranges and racial groups, with only a small proportion linked to higher rates. The only two high rate flow is to 15-24 and 25-44 age American Indian & Alaska Native.In contrast, males display a notable concentration of high suicide rates overall. The only three low rate flow is to 45-64 Asian and 65 older Blakc and Asian. The diagram also emphasizes that the 45-64 and 65 older age ranges tend to have relatively low suicide rates across both sexes and races, whereas the 25-44 and 15-24 age ranges exhibit more variability and higher rates for specific demographics."

    "text": "In our project of analysis suicide rates, we explored hierarchical relationships in the dataset, time series trends, and correlations across demographic factors, with a focus on the year 2021. The trends exploration underscored age-related vulnerabilities, with younger groups like 15-24 and 25-44 have more rapid increasing suicide rate compared to middle-aged and older groups. We superisingly find that American Indian and Alaska Native individuals, especially males aged 25-44, consistently exhibited the highest suicide rates, followed by White males across older age groups. Females generally had lower rates, except for specific subpopulations like American Indian and Alaska Native women aged 25-44. Despite these insights, the study faced limitations. The most essential one is that we only use the data from 2021 for analysis, which contained significant missing values, such as those for Native Hawaiian females, potentially skewing the findings. By focusing on a single year, we could not explore temporal trends or assess whether the observed patterns are consistent over time. Future directions should include a longitudinal analysis to assess trends and correlations over time, improving completeness and robustness. Moreover, the hierarchical and overlapping nature of the dataset posed challenges, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to handle such complexities effectively. From this project, we gain the critical ability of managing complex hierarchical datasets, dealing with overlapping classifications, and using effective visualization tools to clarify relationships within the data. Moreover, we gained experience in balancing simplicity and depth in data representation, handling missing values thoughtfully, and conduct analyses to address specific questions while maintaining a broader perspective."
